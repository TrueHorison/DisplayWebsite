# DisplayWebsite
Here is a display of some of my more notable projects I have completed.
The website is broken down into machine learning projects, games, and other things that I'm proud of.
This is not a complete catalogue of everything I have ever created however it is simple a visual representation of some of my skill.

The website is available at this url: https://truehorison.github.io/display.github.io/
